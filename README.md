# Transformation Algorithms
We implement two transformation algorithms including Fibonacci-to-Type-II and 
Type-II-to-Fibonacci and run the code on a 4-bit Fibonacci 
NLFSR and the 256-bit Galois NLFSR in Espresso cipher respectively.

We also implement the comparison of Espresso, Espresso-a and Espresso-b, and the 
comparison of Espresso, Espresso-F and Espresso-F2.

# Scripts
Our algorithms are implemented in pure Python3, no any other
dependencies are required. There are four scripts in the directory
of 'algorithms_with_examples' and all these scripts can be executed independently.

Running them is pretty simple. For example, to run 'Uniform_FTG.py' script, just
open your terminal or IDE and type `python Uniform_FTG.py`. All the input
parameters are adjustable. More Details about these scripts are below.

#### 1. Uniform_FTG.py
The implementation of the Fibonacci-to-Type-II transformation algorithm. <br>

For example, we transform a 4-bit Fibonacci NLFSR into all the possible
uniform Galois NLFSRs. <br>
**Inputs:** <br>
Input parameters of the Fibonacci NLFSR. <br>
* The size of the Fibonacci NLFSR `n = 4`.
* The number of rounds to run the NLFSR `R = 1000`.
* The feedback functions of the Fibonacci NLFSR
`F = [[[1]], [[2]], [[3]], [[0], [1], [3], [1, 2]]]` denotes <br>
![figure](figures/fig_8.png) <br>
* The output function of the Fibonacci NLFSR `Z = [[2, 3]]` denotes <br>
![figure](figures/fig_9.png) <br>
* The randomly generated initial state of the Fibonacci NLFSR such as
`N0 = [0, 1, 1, 1]` denotes <br>
![figure](figures/fig_3.png) <br>
* The monomials to be shifted `M = [[1], [3], [1, 2]]` denotes monomials
x1, x3 and x1x2.

**Outputs:** <br>
Output all the possible equivalent Galois NLFSRs. For example, one of
the Galois NLFSR is represented by following parameters. <br>
* The end positions the monomials are shifted to `BFTG = [3, 1, 2]`
denote that x1 is not shifted, x3 is shifted to f1 and x1x2 is shifted to f2. <br>
* The compensation list `CFTG = [-1, -1, [[1]], [[2], [0, 1]]]` (-1 represents 0 in the description of the algorithm) <br>
* The feedback functions of the Galois NLFSR
`FFGal = [[[1]], [[2], [1]], [[3], [0, 1]], [[0], [1]]]` denotes <br>
![figure](figures/fig_10.png) <br>
* The output function of the Galois NLFSR `ZGal = [[1], [2], [0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 3], [0, 1, 2]]` denotes <br>
![figure](figures/fig_11.png) <br>
* The initial state of the Galois NLFSR `N0Gal = [0, 1, 0, 0]` denotes <br>
![figure](figures/fig_6.png)

#### 2. Uniform_GTF.py
The implementation of the Type-II-to-Fibonacci transformation algorithm. <br>

The input Galois NLFSR must be an uniform NLFSR. <br>
For example, we run the code on the 256-bit Galois NLFSR
in Espresso cipher and successfully transform it into a LFSR with feedback
function below. <br>
![figure](figures/fig_7.png) <br>
The corresponding output function and the initial state of the LFSR
are output in the result. The length of the output function is the
number of monomials in the function.  <br>

To be noted, all the uniform Galois NLFSRs transformed in this script
can be transformed by using Generalized_GTF.py as well. <br>
        
#### 3. Espresso_a_b.py
Compare the output sequence of the Espresso, Espresso-a and Espresso-b. <br> 

The feedback functions `FFGal_a`and output function `ZGal_a` of the Espresso-a
are from reference [16] in the paper.
The parameters of Espresso-b are obtained from running Uniform_GTF.py and Uniform_FTG.py on
Espresso, which shows that the output function `FFGal_b` of Espresso-b has 104
variables and 1988 monomials. In the script, the parameter of the output
function `ZGal_b` reads from file ZGal_b.txt.<br>

The result shows that Espresso cipher is equivalent to Espresso-b not Espresso-a.<br>

#### 4. Espresso_F_F2.py
Compare the output sequence of the Espresso, Espresso-F and Espresso-F2. <br> 

The feedback functions `FFGal_F`and output function `ZGal_F` of the Espresso-F
are from reference [2] in the paper.
The parameters of Espresso-F2 are obtained from running Uniform_FTG.py on
Espresso, which shows that the output function `FFGal_F2` of Espresso-F2 has 104
variables and 7942 monomials. In the script, the parameter of the output
function `ZGal_F2` reads from file ZGal_F2.txt.<br>

The result shows that Espresso cipher is equivalent to Espresso-F2 not Espresso-F.<br>
